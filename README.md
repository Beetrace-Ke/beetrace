# BeeTrace

BeeTrace empowers Kenya‚Äôs beekeeping sector by leveraging [Internet Computer (ICP)](https://internetcomputer.org/) blockchain technology to address key challenges: adulteration, capital shortages, and unmonetized pollination benefits. With a potential to produce 55,000 tonnes of honey annually but currently yielding only 11,000 tonnes, Kenya‚Äôs 2 million beekeepers face limited exports (2% of production) and low yields from traditional hives (5‚Äì10 kg vs. 20‚Äì40 kg for modern hives). BeeTrace introduces:

- **NFT-based Honey Traceability**: Ensures transparency with ICRC-7 NFTs for honey batches.
- **$BEE Token Crowdfunding**: Funds modern hives through ICRC-1 token investments.
- **Tokenized Pollination Credits**: Monetizes pollination for biodiversity and carbon sequestration.
- **Mobile dApp**: An Android-first interface for rural beekeepers, optimized for low literacy.

Our platform features a website with a landing page and integrated tools to manage traceability, crowdfunding, and carbon credits, unlocking higher yields, boosting exports, and incentivizing conservation.

## Features

1. **Honey Traceability**  
   - Mint ICRC-7 NFTs for honey batches, storing beekeeper ID, location, and quality data.  
   - Buyers verify authenticity via QR codes on the website or dApp.

2. **Crowdfunding**  
   - Beekeepers list hive projects on the platform.  
   - Investors purchase $BEE tokens (ICRC-1) for returns from honey sales.

3. **Pollination Credits**  
   - Simulate IoT data to tokenize pollination as tradable carbon credit NFTs.  
   - Supports biodiversity and carbon sequestration markets.

4. **Mobile dApp**  
   - Android-first interface for rural beekeepers.  
   - Optimized for low-literacy users to manage traceability, crowdfunding, and credits.

## Repository Structure

- **/frontend**  
  - Website with landing page and platform feature interfaces (e.g., React, Vue.js).  
  - UI for traceability, crowdfunding, pollination credits, and dApp preview.

- **/backend**  
  - APIs and services for website and platform features.  
  - Handles NFT minting, $BEE token crowdfunding, pollination credit tokenization, and QR code generation.  
  - Integrates with ICP blockchain for smart contracts.

- **/mobile-dapp**  
  - Android-first mobile app for beekeepers.  
  - Manages traceability, crowdfunding, and pollination data with a low-literacy interface.

- **/docs**  
  - Documentation for setup, APIs, smart contracts, and user guides.
